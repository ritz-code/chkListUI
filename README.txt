This is my representation of the Digital Checklist plugin.

Since, this was a small plugin, i decided to go with vanillaJS, JQuery and CSS. If i would get to refactor it, i would like to
go with ReactJS, because it provides a clean separation of state and methods. Though, I have provided some separation of code and 
data, i would definitely want to refactor it some more. 

For this specific project, i focused more on clean lines, and design.

I started with Flattening the JSON provided and modified the data to be stored as an array of objects. After fetching the data,
i displayed it dynamically in a DataTable.
